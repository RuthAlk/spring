Test project to figure out how Spring Boot REST servers and angular front-end work together

To try, do this:

```docker-compose build```

```docker-compose up -d```


Point your browser to http://localhost:7070

Current state is unfortunately frontend cannot reach backend.

It does work when running locally, but not in docker-compose
